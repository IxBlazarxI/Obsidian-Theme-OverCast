## Overview:

Overcast is the first theme I made for Obsidian. While I don't have much experience with CSS, I thought it would be fun to customize my workspace to make it look pleasant and motivate me to work more efficiently.

This theme features a beautiful rain wallpaper, which is a screenshot from one of my favorite games. The image is subtly blurred with the brightness turned down for a serene and focused aesthetic.

## Features:

- Custom rainy wallpaper with adjusted brightness and blurriness for a cleaner and atmospheric look
- Subtle, dark theme for better readability and focus
- Simple and clean design
- Mobile-friendly adjustments: the sidebar no longer blends with the wallpaper and has its own blurred effect
